Docker containers for reuse in other projects
---------------------------------------------
By reusing containers you make sure that containers in a project share as many layers as posible.
The containers are named by tags.
E.g.:
mfrellum/base:min
mfrellum/base:python
mfrellum/base:web2py
mfrellum/base:apache
